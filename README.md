# zztetris

Link to discord for this project: <https://discord.gg/Z3qDF4DVxJ>

a tetris client with a name that starts with zz so you can type zz and have it autocomplete

forked from aznguy's schoolteto, a number of features added

inspired by fio's four-tris

Fumen import/export / image import works through your clipboard.  
Undo/redo is a thing. It keeps track of your board state history.
*Full* fumen import/export sets your board state history as the fumen pages and vice versa.
Drawing on the board is a thing.
