A tetris client with a name that starts with zz so you can type zz and have it autocomplete

Forked from [aznguy's schoolteto](https://github.com/aznguymp4/schoolTeto) with a number of features added

Inspired by fio's four-tris

## Features (probably buggy lol)

- Fumen import/export
- Image import works through clipboard
- Undo/redo with board history
- *Full* fumen import/export sets your board state history as the fumen pages and vice versa.
- Drawing garbage on the board

## Changelog

*Do we need this changelog? I feel like git messages and maybe tags are good enough. - g3ner1c*

Add 2 visible rows to the top of board; pieces spawn 2 higher
top out detection
